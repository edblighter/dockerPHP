## Features

- **Multiple PHP Versions:** Switch between PHP 5.6, 7.4, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4.
- **Flexible Web Servers:** Choose between Nginx (default) or Caddy with automatic HTTPS.
- **Database Variety:** Supports MySQL (default), MariaDB, and PostgreSQL.
- **Essential Tools:** Comes with Redis for caching and Mailpit for email testing.
- **Easy Management:** Use `run.sh` for command-line operations or `menu.sh` for an interactive experience.
- **Auxiliary Services:** Includes optional services like Portainer, Traefik, and Jenkins for advanced management and CI/CD.

## ‚úÖ Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- `sudo` permissions

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

1.  **Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.**

2.  **Place your PHP project files in the `app/` directory.**
    The `app/` directory is mounted as the web server's root:
    - Nginx: `/var/www`
    - Caddy: `/srv`

3.  **Run the interactive setup menu:**
    ```bash
    ./menu.sh
    ```
    Alternatively, use the `run.sh` script for a non-interactive setup. For example, to start with Nginx and MySQL:
    ```bash
    ./run.sh -w nginx -d mysql up
    ```

4.  **Access your application:**
    - **Nginx:** [http://info.localhost:8000](http://info.localhost:8000)
    - **Caddy:** [https://info.localhost](https://info.localhost) (ignore the self-signed certificate warning)

## üì¶ Usage

This environment is managed by two main scripts: `run.sh` and `menu.sh`.

### Interactive Menu (`menu.sh`)

For a guided setup, simply run:
```bash
./menu.sh
```
This script will walk you through selecting a web server, database, and other options.

### Command-Line Script (`run.sh`)

The `run.sh` script provides a direct way to manage the environment.

**Syntax:**
```bash
./run.sh [options] [command]
```

**Options:**
| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `-w`, `--web <server>` | Choose a web server (`nginx` or `caddy`). | `nginx` |
| `-d`, `--database <db>` | Choose a database (`mysql`, `mariadb`, or `postgres`). | `mysql` |
| `-H`, `--help` | Display the help screen. | |

**Commands:**
| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `up` | Start and build the services. |
| `down` | Stop the services. |
| `clear` | Stop and remove all containers, volumes, and data. **Warning: This is destructive.** |

**Examples:**
```bash
# Start with Nginx and MySQL
./run.sh -w nginx -d mysql up

# Stop the environment
./run.sh down

# Clear the entire environment
./run.sh clear
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

- **Environment Variables:** Customize versions, ports, and other settings in `.env.app`.
- **PHP Configuration:** Adjust PHP settings in `services/php/conf/php.ini` and `www.conf`.
- **Service Configuration:** Modify the `docker-compose.yml` files and `.env` files within each service's directory for more advanced changes.

---

## üí° Troubleshooting

- **Port Conflicts:** If a service fails to start, check if the required ports are already in use. You can change the ports in the corresponding `.env` files.
- **Permission Errors:** Ensure that the user running the Docker commands has the necessary permissions to access the Docker daemon and the project files.
- **Logs:** To inspect the logs of a specific container, use `docker logs <container_name>`.
- **Resetting the Environment:** If you encounter persistent issues, you can reset the entire environment with `./run.sh clear`. **Warning: This will delete all data.**
